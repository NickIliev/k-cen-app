# Translation Feature Documentation

## Overview
The Happy Kids Center website now supports bilingual functionality with Bulgarian and English languages.

## Implementation

### Language System Components

1. **Translation Context** (`src/contexts/LanguageContext.jsx`)
   - Manages current language state
   - Provides translation function `t()`
   - Handles localStorage persistence
   - Default language: Bulgarian (bg)

2. **Translation Data** (`src/translations/index.js`)
   - Contains all text content in both languages
   - Organized by sections (nav, home, gallery, pricing, etc.)
   - Nested object structure for easy maintenance

3. **Language Switcher** (`src/components/LanguageSwitcher.jsx`)
   - Dropdown component with flag icons
   - Appears in the navigation bar
   - Responsive design with mobile optimization

### Usage

#### Basic Translation Function
```javascript
import { useLanguage } from '../contexts/LanguageContext'

const MyComponent = () => {
  const { t } = useLanguage()
  
  return <h1>{t('home.hero.title')}</h1>
}
```

#### Available Languages
- **Bulgarian (bg)**: Default language, flag 🇧🇬
- **English (en)**: Secondary language, flag 🇺🇸

#### Language Switching
- Click the language switcher in the navigation
- Language preference is saved to localStorage
- Page content updates immediately

### Key Features

1. **Persistent Language Selection**: User's language choice is remembered across sessions
2. **Fallback Support**: Falls back to English if translation is missing
3. **Responsive Design**: Language switcher adapts to mobile screens
4. **Professional UI**: Modern dropdown with smooth animations

### Translation Keys Structure

```
nav: Navigation items
home: Homepage sections (hero, about, features, testimonials)
gallery: Gallery page content
pricing: Pricing page content  
contact: Contact page content
reservations: Booking form content
footer: Footer links and information
common: Shared terms (yes, no, loading, etc.)
```

### Adding New Translations

1. Add the new text key to both `en` and `bg` objects in `src/translations/index.js`
2. Use the translation key in your component: `{t('section.key')}`
3. Test both languages to ensure proper display

### Font Integration

The website uses the Roboto font family from `public/fonts/` directory:
- All text uses Roboto as the primary font
- Supports both languages with proper character rendering
- Fallback fonts ensure compatibility

### Current Status

**Translated Pages:**
- ✅ Navigation & Footer (fully translated)
- ✅ Home page (complete Bulgarian and English versions)
- ✅ Gallery page (titles and descriptions translated)
- ✅ Pricing page (main content and pricing cards translated)
- ✅ Contact page (form labels, placeholders, and sections translated)
- ✅ Reservations page (main sections and step titles translated)

**Translation Implementation Status:**
- ✅ Core translation infrastructure complete
- ✅ Language switcher fully functional
- ✅ All main page titles and descriptions translated
- ✅ Navigation and footer completely translated
- ✅ Form labels and placeholders translated
- ⚠️ Some detailed content sections may need minor updates

**Next Steps:**

- Add any missing form validation messages in both languages
- Consider adding more languages if needed (German, French, etc.)
- Update detailed content sections if needed

### Technical Notes

- React Context API used for state management
- CSS modules for component styling
- Responsive design with mobile-first approach
- Performance optimized with proper memoization
